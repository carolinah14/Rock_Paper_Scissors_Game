# Rock_Paper_Scissors_Game
This is a simple text-based Rock Paper Scissors game where you play against the computer!
A beginner-friendly Python project from my 100 Days of Code journey.

🧠 What I learned

How to use lists and indexes in Python

How to apply conditional logic (if, elif, else)

How to generate random choices with the random module

How to validate user input

Practiced using comparison operators (<, >, ==) and logical operators (and, or)

🎮 How it works

You choose between Rock (0), Paper (1), or Scissors (2)

The computer randomly selects one option

The program compares both choices and displays the result:

Win 🎉

Lose 💀

Tie 🤝

If the input is invalid, the program lets you know right away
